# Simple Git Configuration Script
I've made this simple script to help me to spend less time configuring GIT in Linux.

Hope you like it, and feel free to modificate as you want :)

## Instalation and execution
Just clone this repository wherever you want and executes it by using:
> ./gitconfig $1 $2

+ $1 - Is your account name, or the name you want.
+ $2 - Is your account email.

After that, just add your ssh public key to github configs.
